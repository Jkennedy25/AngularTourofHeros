# AngularTourofHeros
Tour of Heroes application site using Angular

This purpose of this project is to build an angular web application called Tour of Heroes. In this project, I was able to set up a local angular development environment and use the Angular CLI to develop an application. The website contians a list of hero names in a list form. The user is able to make edits to a heroes details and navigate between different views of Heroes. This project has introduced myself to Angular and the functions used to create live applications.
